Excel table to DMN decision table converter
===========================================

This project has two components:

1. A standalone converter to transform Excel worksheets (xlsx files) into DMN decision tables (dmn files), implemented and embeddable in Java.
2. A [Camunda BPM](https://www.camunda.org) process engine plugin to enable xlsx deployment as part of process applications. Xlsx files are then converted on the fly to DMN tables.

Features
--------

* Conversion of Excel worksheets to DMN decision tables with inputs, outputs and rules
* Pluggable strategy to determine columns that represent inputs and outputs
* Comes as a Java library that can be embedded into custom applications
* Comes as a command line application to execute standalone
* Comes as a process engine plugin to integrate with process application deployments

Usage
-----

### Standalone Converter

#### Command Line

1. [Download the command line tool](https://app.camunda.com/nexus/content/groups/public/org/camunda/bpm/extension/dmn/dmn-xlsx-cli/0.2.0/dmn-xlsx-cli-0.2.0.jar). It is a runnable jar file, so you need to have Java installed.
2. Take an Excel file that contains a decision to convert and place it next to the downloaded jar.
3. Execute `java -jar dmn-xlsx-cli-0.2.0.jar --inputs A,B,C --outputs D,E,F path/to/input/file.xlsx path/to/output/file.dmn`. Note that this example assumes the columns A, B, and C are inputs and D, E, F are outputs. You can set these as you like.
4. Obtain the dmn table and import it in Camunda modeler or in the [online DMN table editor](http://demo.bpmn.io/dmn).

#### Java

##### Artifacts

To use the Java library, add the following Maven dependency to your project:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.camunda.bpm.extension.dmn</groupId>
  <artifactId>dmn-xlsx-converter</artifactId>
  <version>0.2.0</version>
</dependency>
```

##### Read Excel file, transform to DMN, write to DMN file:

```java
InputStream xlsxInputStream = ...; // open xlsx file here

// convert
XlsxConverter converter = new XlsxConverter();
DmnModelInstance dmnModelInstance = converter.convert(inputStream);

// write
OutputStream dmnOutputStream = ...; // open outputstream to file here
Dmn.writeModelToStream(dmnOutputStream, dmnModelInstance);
```

##### Configure conversion

The class `org.camunda.bpm.dmn.xlsx.XlsxConverter` has bean properties that allow configuration of the conversion process. These are:

* `ioDetectionStrategy`: An instance of `org.camunda.bpm.dmn.xlsx.InputOutputDetectionStrategy`. The default strategy assumes that all but the last column of the worksheet are inputs and the last column is an output. An instance of `org.camunda.bpm.dmn.xlsx.StaticInputOutputDetectionStrategy` can be set to define a static set of input and output columns. Custom strategies can be implemented by implementing the interface `InputOutputDetectionStrategy`.

### Camunda BPM process engine plugin

#### Artifacts

The process engine artifact can be obtained via the following Maven coordinates:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.camunda.bpm.extension.dmn</groupId>
  <artifactId>dmn-xlsx-process-engine-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>0.2.0</version>
</dependency>
```

#### Configuration

Make sure to make the resulting `org.camunda.bpm.dmn:dmn-xlsx-process-engine-plugin` artifact available on the process engine's classpath. Then configure the class `org.camunda.bpm.xlsx.plugin.XlsxDmnProcessEnginePlugin` as a process engine plugin.

#### Usage

With the plugin in place, xlsx files can be included in a deployment and are automatically recognized and converted into DMN XML at deployment time. To configure conversion for a file `<name>.xlsx`, a file `<name>.xlsx.yaml` can be included in the deployment. Example yaml contents:

```yaml
---
inputs: ['A', 'B']
outputs: ['C', 'E']
```

This declares that the columns A and B are inputs of the decision and C and E are outputs.
